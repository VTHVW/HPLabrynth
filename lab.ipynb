        "To check a labyrinth we first need to retrieve the Labirynth parameters from a file, this is done with the `HPLAbrynth::getLabParamsFromFile` function. We can directly pass the output of this function to the HPLab constructor.\n",

        "This will initialize the DS data structure, calling `makeSet` on each cell.\n",

Every operation of the DS data structure implemented (link,find and unite) does nothing when called on an invalid cell. This simplifies the class logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally to check if the labrynth is valid we can call `HPLab::hasPath`. This method will call `unite` on every set, linking the ones that are not separated by invalid cells (on which `link` does nothing). This method returns a bool which is simply `find(start) == find(end)`. Indeed the path is found if start and end are part of a connected graph (and therefore have the same set representative).\n",
